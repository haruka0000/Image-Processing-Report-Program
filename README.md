# Image processing Report Program

This is our learning progress about image processing.

## 1. ellipse_estimate.py is able to estimate 6 parameters of ellipse using LSM(least squares method) and MLE(maximun likelihood estimation).

## 2. imageproc.py can estimate scaling and rotation parameters between two imgages using hough transportation method and feature matching method.

## To run
### Environments
- Python 3.6.9
- Linux, Windows10

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 1. Ellipse parameters estimation
python ellipse_estimate.py

Please wait a moment...
It will take up to 15 minutes, depending on the specs of your PC.

Our program will open your brouser after the estimation.

On the brouser, you can get the screenshot of graph drawing.

###  2. scaling and rotation parameters estimation
You should prepare 2 images, first is original image, another is scaled and rotated one.
